                <p>We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in mind. That's why we believe it's
                    always
                    worth
                    trying to fix a system before outright replacing it, wherever possible – it requires fewer materials
                    and
                    is
                    easier on the planet, as well as your wallet! If another company tells you that your system needs to
                    be
                    replaced, just give us a call and we'll see if we can repair it first.</p>

                    <p>As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come cheap. Our aim is to make solar
